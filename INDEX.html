<p> <b> "Some people have nothing to eat" </b> The United Nations estimates in its latest report that between 702 and 828 million people are affected by this problem. In the United States, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) shows that 10.2% of households have problems obtaining food on a daily basis, which means about 34 million people, 9 millions of whom are children.

Feeding America reveals that in New York 1 million 882 thousand 580 people face food insecurity, and the borough most affected is the Bronx. In 2020, 19.7% of its residents faced this problem, double the average in the rest of the city. The organization 'Hunger Free America' recently detailed that 1 in 4 Bronx residents had nothing to eat. </p>

    <p> <b> In the Bronx, the New York's borough with the highest rate of food insecurity, one in four people have nothing to eat. Here, where Blacks and Latinos are the most at-risk populations, some citizen initiatives seek to address the problem. Daniel Zauderer, executive director of Grassroots Grocery, a nonprofit organization, says “there is an urgent need to take action to facilitate access to food and open the way for large companies or even schools feel free donate their remaining food”, and he believes in neighbors helping neighbors, also he thinks the food insecurity is a problem that all society has to fight together. </b> </p>
