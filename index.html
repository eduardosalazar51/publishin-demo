	<h1>It looks like he were go again BUT no... here we are to OVERMCOME THE STIGMA!</h1>
	<p>To be clear. Monkeypox is NOT a "gay" disease even when the statistics make it look like that. Some people speech against gay community as well they can... but if we learn something about HIV epidemic in 1990 is framing it is a "gay" disease is misleading and hinders us from properly stopping the outbreak. And also, we are not in the 1990. 

    The world change. And our mind too, if don´t, so go the psycologist inmediately. We have to recognize something and it´s the virus has affected more LGBTQI community so far... but not all of them are gay, they are MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN, and maybe you think "oh... so they are gay". The quick answer is not. At all. And why? There´s a difference betweeen identity and sexual preferences, many men have sex with men andd they consider themselves straight people, and actually sure you know some of them and don not know they have sex with another men, and actually you do not have to know that... that´s not your businnes... not mine. Even when we are worried about many of these men have also wifes, women, and a family, children... and the point is not stigmatized them, they are victims of the social stigma about gay, and that´s why some of them hide their preferences. 

    A factual thing is Monkeypox has been able to easily spread though close, skin to skin contact within all the people.

 <p>We have a list of human rights - right to food, right to shelter, right to health, right to education, many such items which are considered and accepted as bill of rights. These are to be insured to people. So all nations, all societies try to do that.
